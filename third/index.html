            Staying connected by cellphone <br>
            The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities 
            are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that <br>
            makes for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and 
            dozens of other countries worldwide. In the U.S., T-Mobile, AT&T 
            Wireless, and Cingular use this quasi-universal system; in Canada, Fido <br>
            and some Rogers customers are GSM; and all Europeans and most 
            Australians use GSM.Staying connected by cellphone 
            The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities <br>
            are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that
            makes for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and <br>
            dozens of other countries worldwide. In the U.S., T-Mobile, AT&T 
            Wireless, and Cingular use this quasi-universal system; in Canada, Fido 
            and some Rogers customers are GSM; and all Europeans and most 
            Australians use GSM.<br>
            If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable 
            multiband phone such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung 
            models, you can make and receive calls across much of the globe. Just <br>
            call your wireless operator and ask for international roaming to be acti- 
            vated on your account. Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be high, 
            usually $1 to $1.50 in Western Europe. <br>
            That’s why buying an “unlocked” world phone is important. Many cell- 
            phone operators sell “locked” phones that restrict you from using any 
            removable computer memory phone chip (called a SIM card) other than <br>
            the ones they supply. Having an unlocked phone allows you to install a 
            cheap, prepaid SIM card (found at a local retailer) in your destination 
            country. (Show your phone to the salesperson; not all phones work on <br>
            all networks.) You’ll get a local phone number and much, much lower 
            calling rates. Getting an already locked phone unlocked can be a compli- 
            cated process, but it can be done; just call your cellular operator and 
            say you’ll be going abroad for several months and want to use the phone 
            with a local provider. <br>
            For many, rentinga phone is a good idea. Although you can rent a phone 
            from any number of overseas sites — including kiosks at airports — we 
            suggest renting the phone before you leave home. That way you can give <br>
            loved ones and business associates your new number, make sure the 
            phone works, and take the phone wherever you go. This option is espe- 
            cially helpful for overseas trips through several countries, where local <br>
            phone-rental agencies often bill in local currency and may not let you 
            take the phone to another country.<br>
